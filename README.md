Sr Project Fall 2014

This was my senior project for Clarion University of PA, where we took a problem through the entire SDLC. The problem this application solved was replacing a 22 year old (a Sr project from 1992) DOS based system that was to be eliminated by spring 2015 when the XP machine it was on would no longer be allowed on the network. The biggest challenge with the project was the client, who had been using the old system since it's creation and did his own maintenance on the system, and initially wanted a modern application that looked identical and ran identical to the DOS system, as well as he wanted to preform the maintenance himself still. I designed the UI, which was important to get him to abandon the DOS mindset, and was also half of the coding team for the main application. The database was handled mostly by a third group member, but towards the end of the semester as my SQL knowledge had increased I wrote most of the SQL statements within the C# project and changed a few things within the database to fix issues we had run into.
